# Variables
Variables hold data.

This data is accessed by name, and can be manipulated.

## Creation
Creating and setting are done in one expression.

The following creates a variable of the name `var`, and sets to an initial value.

```
var = 3
```

Manipulating looks the same.

The data is not required to adhere to the same type that it had on creation.

```
var = 3
var = "Text"
```

## Accessing
Accessing simply requires the identifier.

Observe how the output value is accessed the same as a literal.

```
print(3)
```

```
asdf = 3
print(asdf)
```
