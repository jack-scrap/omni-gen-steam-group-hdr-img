Hello.

This guide will run you through programming for Omni corporation.

Are you familiar with the Python 3 programming language?

If not, read "py.txt".

If so, proceed.

# Creating a file
Hit [F3] to enter the command-line.

Type `open` followed by the name of a buffer -- `open file.py`, and hit [Enter] to execute.
This will create a new buffer of the specified name.

Type `print('Text')`.
This placeholder Python code provides a basic way to test functionality via output.

Execute the command `run` to execute the contents of the buffer.

This buffer will be ran, and the output will be displayed to the external console.

# Saving
To save this file, execute the command `save`.

# Scripting
Interfaces to data and vehicles are provided via the library `omni`.

Type `import omni`.

Initial and desired state are provided.

To complete the level, refactor the initial state until it is equal to the desired state.

To do so, vehicles are provided.

The level is marked as complete upon making the desired data set equal to the one provided.

Player rank is tracked.
Upon level completion, this rank will be increased.
Given increased rank, further levels will be made writeable and open to editing.

A full list of commands and hotkeys can be found in "omni.txt".

# Configuration
The `cfg` directory contains files that will be evaluated on startup.

See `cfg.txt` for a list of available options.
