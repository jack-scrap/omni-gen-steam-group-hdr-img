"Unix time" defines the number of elapsed seconds since Jan 1 1970.
In order to convert this number into a readable format, special characters preceeded with "%" can be provided to calculate and format specific time constructs.

Definitions are provided in a continuous string -- "%m %d, %y".

Below is a complete list of defined tokens and their expansions.
