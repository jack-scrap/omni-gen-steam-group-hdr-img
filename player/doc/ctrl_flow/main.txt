The following will run you through the order of execution in a program, referred to as "control-flow".

# Scope
Like functions, the blocks defined in control-flow have scope.

Variables can be defined, expressions can be evaluated and other statements can be nested.

```
if 3 == 7:
	var = 3

	if 3 == 12
		...
```

# Conditionals
Conditionals handle a condition and a block of code.

## if
The `if` statement will only execute its given block of code should the condition be true.

This can be used to only execute statements should certain circumstances be met.

```
if 3 == 7:
	...
```

## elif
The `elif` statements are additional statements following the first.

```
if 3 == 7:
	print("Yes")

elif 3 == 12:
	...
```

## else
The `else` statement may follow an existing `if` statement, and will executed should none of the previous conditions be met.

No condition is required, simply handling every other case.

```
if 3 == 7:
	print("Yes")

elif 3 == 12:
	print("Yes")

else:
	...
```

# Loops
Loops will run repeatedly until a condition is met.

This is useful for handling sets of data that are redundant, where blocks can be re-used.

## while
The general-purpose "while" loop executes a block of code while the condition remains true.

```
while 3 < 7:
	print("Yes")
```

Because this condition is true, and the program cannot proceed beyond the loop, the block will execute forever.

By manipulating this condition within the block of code itself, a running loop can alter its future behavior and terminate itself.

An example of running this loop a determined number of times can be examplified as follows:

```
i = 0
while i < 3:
	print(i)

	i += 1
```

# Statements
## Short-circuiting
The `break` statement will terminate the loop, ignoring the rest of the current iteration and all future ones.

```
i = 0
while i < 3:
	i += 1

	break
```

Here, the first iteration will run until the `break` statement is executed, at which point the current iteration terminates and no future ones will execute.

## continue
The `continue` will ignore the rest of the current iteration, and proceed to the next.

```
i = 0 
while i < 3:
	continue

	i += 1
```

# pass
The `pass` keyword substitutes a block of code where one is required, the syntax requiring some kind of statement.

```
if 3 == 7:
	pass
```

This keyword is merely a placeholder.
Unlike `break`, the following statements in the block will execute:

```
if 3 == 7:
	pass

	print('Text')
```
