The following will run you through the process of creating and using dictionaries.

Like "lists", "dictionaries" are comma-separated sequences of items enclosed by braces `{}`.

The items are pairs.

These pairs are colon separated.

However, the items are pairs, where a "key" is associated to a value.

`key: 3`

Keys may be of a scalar type (`int`, `float`, `char`, `string`), and also strings.

Values may be scalar types or vector types (lists, other dictionaries).

```
dict = {
	'key': 3,
	'other_key': 'Text'
}
```

# Accessing
Accessing these works like the lists, providing the arbitrary value instead of the index.

```
print(dict['key'])
```
