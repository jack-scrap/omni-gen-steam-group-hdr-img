# Variables
Variables hold data.

This data is accessed by name, and can be manipulated.

## Creation
Creating and setting are done in one expression.

The following creates a variable of the name `var`, and sets to an initial value.

```
var = 3
```

Manipulating looks the same.

The data is not required to adhere to the same type that it had on creation.

```
var = 3
var = "Text"
```

## Accessing
Accessing simply requires the identifier.

Observe how the output value is accessed the same as a literal.

```
print(3)
```

```
var = 3
print(var)
```

# Casting
"Casting" is re-interpreting data as another type.

The process of doing so reads like a function with a single argument.

```
var = string(3)
```

In the above snippet, the literal `3` is converted into a string.
