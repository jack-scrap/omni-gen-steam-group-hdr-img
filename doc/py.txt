The following will run you through general workings of the Python 3 programming language.

# Comments
Code following the `#` character will eliminate characters from evaluation until the end of the line.

```
# Text
```

# Indentation
Python uses indentation for code blocks.

These indentations can be multiple.

# Modules
Modules are files.

These modules can be imported into other files for convenient re-use.

Global modules installed on the system, or custom ones in the same directory can be imported with the `import` statement.

```
import module
```

Upon importing, variables and functions defined in the module can be accessed like objects.

```
print(module.var)
```

Specific functions or variables can be imported.

```
from module import var

print(module.var)
```

The `*` can be provided

# Renaming
Both the imported module and the identifiers it contains can be re-named via the `as` keyword.

```from module import *```

## Local namespace
# Dir
`dir()`
