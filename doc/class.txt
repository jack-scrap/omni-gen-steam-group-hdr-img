# Objects
Objects are variables that have properties.

These properties can be of any type, and are eumerable.

## Properties
The `.` operator is used to access these properties.

```
;obj.property
```

# Classes
Classes are templates for creating objects.

This can be used to effectively create a new type.

The following defines a class.

```
class Blueprint:
	def __init__():
		pass
```

The following creates an object that adheres to that class.

```
class Blueprint:
	def __init__():
		pass

obj = Blueprint()
```

## Constructor
The "constructor" is a function of special function that runs on creation of an object.

It is defined as `__init__`

```
class Blueprint:
	def __init__():
		asdf = 3

		pass
```
