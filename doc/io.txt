Input and output describe the process of interacting with the system through the Python 3 programming language.

# File system
Before performing operations, the `open()` function provided by Python will interface with the system to return a handle.

## Reading
Retrieving the text contents of a file is used with the `read()` function

```
handle = open('file.txt', 'r')

buff = handle.read()
```

## Permissions
TODO

## Writing
```
buff = handle.read()
```
