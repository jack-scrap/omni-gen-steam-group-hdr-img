Input and output describe the process of interacting with the system through the programming language.

# Printing
## Input
The `input()` function allows for input via the console.

This will block until input has been provided.

`val = input()`

## Output
`print(3)`

The provided argument may be of any type, and will automatically be formatted into a printable string.

# File system
Before performing operations, the `open()` function will interface with the system to return a handle.

`handle = open('file.txt')`

## Reading
Retrieving the text contents of a file is performed with the `read()` function.

`buff = handle.read()`

## Writing
`handle.write('Text')`

## Permissions
File permissions dictate the ability to perform certain operations.

This can ensure that only the intended operations are not performed.

`r` - Read
`w` - Write
`x` - Execute

These are formatted into a continuous string.

Should the permission be off, `-` will be provided.
Should the permission be on, the respective character will be provided.

`rx-`

The following will only allow read operations on the file handle.

`open('file.txt', 'r--')`
