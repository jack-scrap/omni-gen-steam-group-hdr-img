# Inheritance
The

Doing so can effectively asdf

```
class Parent():
	var = 3

	def fn():
		print("Text")

	def __init__(self):
		pass

class Child(Parent):
	pass
```

Here, the properties have been automatically added.

## Parent property
```
class Asdf:
    def __init__(self):
        self.asdf = 3

        pass

class Qwer(Asdf):
    def __init__(self):
        Asdf.__init__(self)

        pass
```

## Multiple
A child class can inherit from more than one parent.

```
class Parent():
	var = 3

	def fn():
		print("Text")

		def __init__(self):
			pass
	
class OtherParent():
	var = 3

	def fn():
		print("Text")

		def __init__(self):
			pass

class Child(Parent, OtherParent):
	pass
```

## Overriding
Overriding will discard the parent and substitute it with one provided by the child.

```
```
